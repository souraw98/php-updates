What is session and cookie?
***************************

1. When ever we visit a website, we are asked to, accept the cookies..?

    there are two states of website
	1. loginned In
		1. Item add to cart : user_id
	2. Guest State.
		2. Item Add to cart , wish List ---> Guest_id
		
		In order to uniquely Identify the user, 
		server will store few information on your client(Browser)
		This data stored in browser is stored in form cookie.
		cookie is a small file stored in the Browser with some
		data to identify the user uniquely, these information can be Anything.
		
2. What is session ?
   *******************

	session is a data that, can be encrypted or not, which stored on the 
	server side rather than saving at cleint side.
	
	session works like token system, when users logs in any website
	user is given a unique token of 14-digit (variable in length)
	for a perticular time.(1440 seconds) 24 Minute.
	
	session will get stored in tmp folder for the server
	sess_w2e3r4t5y64r1qw2 : filename
		|
		|..some data : serialised data. {data:i:1234|s:9:awnish}
		
	each time when user come, the server going to ask for token,
	if token matched remain here, if not logged Out and will ask you
	re-login and get the token(session) once the user is valid,
	it will give one copy the token to you and other will be stored at server side one given to you will stored in the browser side cookie
	called PHPSESSID.
		
Session is a type of transaction.
Every Transaction has a start and end.
session_start() : transaction start 
Note, every time you deal, with session we have to set up
transaction.
if transaction is done
we use session_destroy() : to End transaction.

How to set the session data 
*****************************
$_SESSION['key]='value';

How to get the session data
*****************************
$varaible_name = $_SESSION['Key'];

How to destroy the session
**************************
1. session_destroy() : destroys the session transaction,
   file sess_id deleted from server tmp folder and cookie is 
	also deleted.

2. session_unset() : it unset the serialised data of the session_id
3. unset() : delete the scope of the varaible from the memory.


How can you change the php.ini without touching
********************************************
ini_set('key','value');
for eg:
session.name = 'PHPSESSID'
ini_set('session.name','mysessionId');

session.save_path = 'c:/laragon/tmp'
ini_set('session.save_path','d:/xyz/tmp');

session.type = 'files'
ini_set('session.files','database');

How to get encrypted Id:-
session_id(); sess_kc0mtb9p07p7e1a0hquoiufreg
kc0mtb9p07p7e1a0hquoiufreg

How to regenerate session_id
******************************
session_regenerate_id() : renegrate the Id if stolen, 
is attack session hijacking/session fixation.
