what is Api:-
Api stands for Application Programming Interface.
Api is a Mechanism by using which One Type Application Can communicate with Another
Application.
In general Api is very Big Topic.

Api are used by different Application to data, from one plateform to another plateform
Worldometer.com Corona Virus Api
Any Application A,B,C,D,E,F,G can utilise the Api of Worldmeter.com to get live update
of corona.

1. InterOperability : Conversion of one type of language to some common langauge so
that data can be exchanged without directly converting the one langauge  to another language.

InterOperability refers to sharing of data, from One Application to Another Application
without changing native langauge, by means of some common Interconversion langauge.
or
Sharing of data from One App to another App without directly converting the native
langauge is called InterOperability.

for Eg:
Android ---> Json ---> Java
Python  ----> JSON ----> java
Python -----> JSON ----> PHP
php ----> JSON ---> SQL

Main Feature of Inter-Operability is Plateform Indepent Nature.

php --(serialisation/JSON Encoding)--> JSON --(Deserialisation/JSON Decode)-> SQL
serialisation/JSON Encoding : converting One Type PL. to JSON Object
Deserialisation/JSON Decode : converting JSON type to One Type of Data-type of PL.

Eg:
php ---> json_encode() ----> json (serialisation)
Associative Array ----> Json
 
Json ----> Json_decode() ---> Associative Array. (De-serialisation)

Soap Architecture Can very very deep that it can be very Complex to handle

what is REST?.

it is Type of Web-Api which works under http protocol.
its representation is always, In Json Format
It will very very Light weight,
Easy to Handle, due to Organised data structure in form of Key and value pairs
